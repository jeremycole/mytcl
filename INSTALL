MyTCL - TCL API to MySQL

Installation Instructions


1. Edit the Makefile

Edit the Makefile, and uncomment the lines that apply to you in the
Operating Systems section.  There are specific lines for FreeBSD, Linux,
and Solaris.  These should usually work.  Your mileage may very, if you
know what you are doing, make it work, and send me details of what you had
to change.  

You must also edit the INSTALL_DIR, MYSQL_LIB, MYSQL_INC, and LIBS lines
to reflect your system.  Soon, I'll have a configure script, so none of
this will be necessary, but it really isn't that hard.


2. Run 'make'

If you didn't do step 1 correctly, this will most likely fail.  If it
does, try step 1 again, if you can't get it to work, email me what your
error message is, and how your system is set up, and I will try and make
it work for you.  If it is a compatibility problem, I may need access to
your system to fix my code on your specific setup.


3. Run 'make install'

This should copy the mytcl extension into your TCL library directory that
you specified in the Makefile.  If it fails, try editing INSTALL_DIR in
the Makefile.


4. Read README and examples/*

I have included a function list in README.  Use it.  If anything is
unclear, or if something seems not to work, email me.


This should help a little with getting MyTCL installed on your system.
After you have it installed, you can use it to write tclsh scripts that
connect to MySQL or eggdrop bots that are smarter than the average bear,
or whatever.  If you need any help, or if something is just totally
broken, email me about it and I'll try to get back to you as soon as
possible.
