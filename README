MyTCL - TCL API to MySQL

In absense of a real manual, I will provide a function list here.
Whenever the real manual is done, this space will be taken by notes and
other stuff you'd expect to find in a readme file.  Sorry for not having
the manual done by my release date. :(

Here goes:

sql version
  Returns version information.

sql connect $host $user $pass
  Connect to MySQL server.
  Returns a mytcl connection handle.  Save that to a variable and use it
  where I say $handle :)

sql selectdb $handle $db
  Select a database on the already connected handle.

sql query $handle $query
  Run a query on a handle, after you've already used connect and selectdb.
  Returns a result, use that where I say $result

sql numrows $handle $result
  Returns number of rows in result set.

sql affectedrows $handle $result
  Returns the number of affected rows.  Usually you'd use this after an
  update or delete, etc.

sql insertid $handle
  Returns the last inserted id that was automatically generated.  ie. an
  auto_increment column.

sql fetchrow $handle $result
  Fetch a row from a result set.
  Returns a TCL list.

sql endquery $handle $result
  End the query.

sql disconnect $handle
  Disconnect from the MySQL server.
